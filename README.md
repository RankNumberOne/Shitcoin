## Why does this coin exist? üòØ

It's a fun way to get people into crypto, with the vision of one day helping those who are battling against colon cancer, prostate cancer, and those just  facing a shitty time in general in life.

### How does this coin grow? üßê

The success of this coin is heavily dependent on the fans to push it to new heights, amd its tokenomics which makes Sh·ì∞t rarer with every transaction.

|  Supply  |   Liqudiity    |  Buy Back & Flush |
|  ------- |    ------      |       ------      | 
|   8bil   |   6% per Tx    |      2% per Tx    |  

The taxes build up tokens in the contract's address: 0xe321c8f2db87af4989cb0138e27d071ff7f7ce10 
Whenever it hits a certain number built up, it sells half for BNB, pairs it with the tokens, and adds more liq.
So if you see this address selling, don't be alarmed; it's just doing its job, even though it's a shitty way of adding liquidity.
