This is the smart contract for the cryptocurrency: Shitcoin, Symbol: SHIT

Why does this coin exist?
This token was developed to help those affected by the recent wave of cryptocurrency meme coin rug pulls that plague DeFi. We’re effectively a safe haven for investors who are fascinated with going to the moon. Furthermore I figured it would be interesting to see if this coin can reach the front page of coin listing sites and high volume exchanges

How does this coin grow?
The success of this coin's moon mission to be listed on Coinbase is heavily dependent on the fans to push it to new heights. Additionally, this coin takes a small percentage to add liquidity, and flush tokens from existence by sending them to the “Burn” address [0x00000dead]

How do I get coins?
You can obtain coins by purchasing them from cryptocurrency exchanges such as Pancakeswap
