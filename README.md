## Why does this coin exist? üòØ

It's a fun way to get people into crypto, with the vision of one day helping those who are battling against colon cancer, prostate cancer, and those just  facing a shitty time in general in life.

### How does this coin grow? üßê

The success of this coin is heavily dependent on the fans to push it to new heights, amd its tokenomics which makes Sh·ì∞t rarer with every transaction.
